This repository contains various R scripts demonstrating the use of the `mlr3` package for machine learning tasks. The scripts include:

- **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML):** Implementation of AutoML techniques.
- **Benchmarking:** Performance comparison of different models.
- **Decision Trees:** Application of decision tree algorithms.
- **Feature Selection (Sonar and Spam Datasets):** Techniques for selecting relevant features using the Sonar and Spam datasets.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO):** Hyperparameter tuning using methods like Autotuner, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization.
- **Interpretable Machine Learning (IML):** Interpretation of model predictions using methods such as LIME, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Shapley values, and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots.
- **K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm:** Implementation of the KNN algorithm.
- **Pipeline Operators:** Use of pipeline operators for data imputation using median and mode strategies.
- **mlr3 Introduction:** Introduction to `mlr3` functionalities, including KNN and performance measures.

These scripts serve as practical examples for applying `mlr3` in various machine learning scenarios.
