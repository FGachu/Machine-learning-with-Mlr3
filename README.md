### About This Repository  

This repository contains various R scripts demonstrating using the `mlr3` package for machine learning tasks.  The key areas covered include:  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**  
   - Implementation of AutoML techniques using **mlr3automl** to automate the selection of models and hyperparameters for improved predictive performance.  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Benchmarking Machine Learning Models**  
   - Comparing the performance of different algorithms on the same dataset to identify the best-performing model.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Decision Trees**  
   - Implementation of the first split of a decision tree 
   -  Using the packages tree to get a nice decision tree of the mtcars data set.  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Feature Selection with Sonar & Spam Datasets**  
   - Techniques to select the most relevant features from datasets using filter and wrapper methods.  
   - Applications to real-world datasets like **Sonar** (for signal classification) and **Spam** (for email filtering).  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)**  
   - Fine-tuning machine learning models using:  
     - **Autotuner** for automated parameter tuning.  
     - **Hyperband** for adaptive resource allocation.  
     - **Bayesian Optimization** for probabilistic tuning strategies.  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Interpretable Machine Learning (IML)**  
   - Understanding model predictions using:  
     - **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** for instance-level interpretation.  
     - **Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)** to visualize feature influence.  
     - **Shapley Values** for feature attribution analysis.  
     - **Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) Plots** for feature impact at an individual level.  

#### ðŸ”¹ **K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Algorithm**  
   - Implementing KNN for classification tasks.  
   - Evaluating model performance with cross-validation.  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Pipeline Operators & Data Preprocessing**  
   - Utilizing `mlr3pipelines` for **data imputation** with strategies like median and mode filling.  
   - Creating automated pipelines for preprocessing and model training.  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Introduction to mlr3**  
   - A beginner-friendly script demonstrating the core functionalities of the **mlr3** package.  
   - Includes an overview of basic classification tasks using **KNN** and common **performance measures**.
